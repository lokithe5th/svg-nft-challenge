# 🌍🌍🌍 WORLDS 🌍🌍🌍
Worlds is an SVG NFT representing new worlds which have different characteristics.

It uses a custom ERC721 implementation that keeps gas costs low. Each World emits Energy (an ERC20 token) which accrues to each NFT and can only be claimed by the owner.

*Please ignore the gas estimation on the front end when minting, this is a bug*

Feel free to take a look at the contract on etherscan: [Worlds](0x4f7dd11B9c5eE9C79eecfF2127bCFf153e0eA49F)

Hope you enjoy 😄 Please reach out to me with any suggestions/feedback @lourenslinde on twitter, I would love to hear from you.
